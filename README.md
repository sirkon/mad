# mad
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sirkon/mad.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sirkon/mad)

This is a literate configuration format library for Go inspired by Markdown. It means this can be
your configuration (screenshot of the preview in VSCode on Ubuntu 17.10):

Read about typical usecases [here](USECASES.md). 
In short, ___mad___ library is useful in cases where pieces of structured data or code are needed and there's not much
nesting in data. 

## Installation

* the prefered way is via the dep
    ```
    dep ensure -add github.com/sirkon/mad    
    ```
* using go get is not recommended, but still should work
    ```
    go get github.com/sirkon/mad
    ```
 

## Simplest usage

Let we have a 
* some temporary table with preaggregated data and several queries running on this table. Let we call
this temporary table creation a *prepare*. 
* quries may run on a temporary table and they also may use other tables
* actually, it is rather uncommon situation when we need a preaggregated table. In the majority of cases we
    will use existing ones. Thus, the *prepare* process is not mandatory.
* prepare query creates table. There should be a method to delete it. 
    
In final, we have
* optionally prepare create and delete queries
* regular queries

Let's express this in a Go structure:

```go
import "github.com/sirkon/mad"
â€¦
var job struct {
	Prepare *struct {
		Create mad.Code `mad:"create"`
		Delete mad.Code `mad:"delete"`
	} `mad:"prepare,syntax=sql"`
	
	Queries []mad.Code `mad:"queries,syntax=sql"`
}
```

It can be decoded from file as

```go
if err := mad.UnmarshalFile(&job, mad.NewContext()); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

And now how the markdown text would look like for this example:

````markdown
# prepare

## create
```sql
CREATE TABLE tmp AS SELECT * FROM table
```

## delete
```sql
DROP TABEL tmp;
```


# queries

* total amount of events
```sql
SELECT count(1) FROM tmp;
```

* amount of users who created events
```sql
SELECT uniq(user_id) FROM tmp;
```
````


* You can also consume integers, floating points, strings and booleans using `raw` code blocks (see [advanced example](HARD.md)):
* you need `mad.Code` type to consume code block
* you need `mad.Comment` type to consume comment block
* comments (everything, that is not header or fenced code block) are normally ignored (this is a bug if they aren't) 
    except the case where you are using `mad.Comment` 


This simple example is not different from what you can used to with stdlib JSON package (except may be only
fields tagged with `mad:".."` can be filled by Decoder). But this is human oriented format and that's why special
interfaces were introduced:
* It is possible to control fragment order in Markdown files (define your `mad.Decodable` type and write down desired decoding order manually)
* It is possible to use header as a source of information, fulfilling fields with data from header text (define your `mad.Manual` type)
* It is possible to reimplement how scalar types are treated (define your own `mad.Unmarshaler` type)
* It is possible to match by regexp, not just by fixed name. Usually `mad.Manual` is used in these cases as a field value type
* It is possible to match against several syntax types, for instance, use `syntax=python perl` to match against perl or python fenced code block

see at the harder example [here](HARD.md)

## Why not to use YAML with text blocks?

Because

* You don't have same "fenced code blocks" in YAML, thus you don't have syntax highlighting, folding, etc for them
* The human readable reporting was in mind, thus you can get positions of code blocks and headers. YAML parsers available
    for go cannot pass this information down to the user.
